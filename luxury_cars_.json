With so much focus on SUVs and crossovers of late, it's no wonder these power brands have stepped up to the plate. The new Bentaya SUV brings eminent practicality and superfluous comfort to the table - but, seated alongside rivals like the Lamborghini Urus and Rolls-Royce Cullinan, it has to remain on its toes to shine in the ultra-luxury segment.So Bentley puts in the work and presents buyers with a modern, family-oriented SUV that is now available with an extended wheelbase, seating up to seven. It comes flush with luxuries and comforts typical of the brand and can be powered by various powerful engines, including a 626-horsepower W12 and a hybrid V6 with 443 hp. While it's not the most beautiful to look at, the Bentayga's spacious and plush cabin are streets ahead of what you'd find on more mainstream cars. But is it enough to dominate in the segment?",  "price": "Call for price.", "url": "https://cdn.carbuzz.com/car-thumbnails/700x375/10000/700/10732.jpg"

Enter the Bentley Bentayga Hybrid. The respected British marque launched the hybrid SUV in 2019, and judging by the fact that the 2023 Bentayga Hybrid lineup has grown from one model to four, it's doing something right.A 3.0-liter V6 engine does duty, paired with an electric motor for combined outputs of 456 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, which is enough to get the Bentayga Hybrid to 60 mph in just over five seconds. These outputs are on par with the Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid, but the German SUV gets up to speed a lot quicker. It also starts at an MSRP that's half of what the Bentayga Hybrid asks for. There aren't currently other ultra-luxury competitors to the Bentley Bentayga PHEV, so it's likely that those shopping under the Flying B banner have already decided to buy one - and there aren't all that many reasons, barring a hefty price tag, to dissuade them.", "price": "Call for price.", "url": "https://cdn.carbuzz.com/car-thumbnails/700x375/9000/900/9997.jpg"

"id": 31, "make": "Lamborghini", "model": "Huracan STO", "year": "2023", "description": "Within the Huracan family hierarchy, the Lamborghini Huracan STO is firmly positioned at the top. This is an unabashed street-legal race car honed for track use, but if you absolutely must, you can also drive it to the mall if you want to turn mundane errands into memorable, hair-raising experiences. The most extreme Huracan uses a 5.2-liter V10 engine that's good for 631 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque. That's as much power as the new Huracan Tecnica, but the STO weighs 88 pounds less than that car in an effort to match the best RS Porsches and long-tail McLarens on the track. Like the 911 GT3 and McLaren 765LT, it's a strictly rear-wheel-drive beast, and in the most savage fashion imaginable, the STO will reach 62 mph in three seconds and a top speed of over 192 mph. It looks outrageous with extreme aero like the huge rear wing, and the new Trofeo mode will allow you to set blistering lap times if you know what you're doing. The Super Trofeo Omologata is a road-homologated supercar that you'll think about long after you've driven it for the first time.", "price": "Call for price.", "url": "https://cdn.carbuzz.com/car-thumbnails/700x375/14000/300/14348.jpg"

In its farewell year now after a decade on the market, the 2023 Lamborghini Huracan Tecnica on review here is a not-so-gentle reminder that there's a fresh new trim of the brash Italian with the operatic tenor voice, and that it will be elbowing its way through the crowd and onto the stage once again for another rock-star performance. Conceived as an in-between car - a wilder Evo or a tamer STO, depending on your take - the 2023 Huracan Tecnica is a purist's delight. It has rear-wheel drive and its wailing 631-horsepower naturally aspirated V10 sitting just behind your right ear comes straight from the STO. So good does Lamborghini reckon the compromise is that they call it the 'perfect fun-to-drive Huracan'. The quarter-million-dollar price of the 2023 Lamborghini Huracan Tecnica puts it squarely in the sights of the more expensive Ferrari F8 Tributo and the cheaper Porsche 911 GT3 and GT3 RS. Has Lamborghini taught the old Huracan any new tricks?", "price": "Call for price.", "url": "https://cdn.carbuzz.com/car-thumbnails/700x375/14000/300/14346.jpg"

An evolution of the already fantastic Huracan that was first introduced in 2014 to replace the Gallardo money-maker, the Huracan Evo is Lamborghini's 'most affordable' and daily drivable supercar. Starting with a price tag north of $200,000, Sant'Agata Bolognese's mid-engined exotic is fitted with a 5.2-liter V10 producing 630 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque. Sending power to all four wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, the Huracan Evo can accelerate from 0-62 mph in 2.9 seconds (3.3 for the RWD), topping out at over 200 mph. The Huracan Evo makes driving gods out of mere mortals in much the same way that a Ferrari 488's Side Slip Angle Control system allows the hamfisted to slide into the next corner instead of into a Mustang's hunting grounds. For those more confident in their abilities, the Evo RWD sends a little less grunt (602 hp and 413 lb-ft) exclusively to the rear wheels.", "price": "Call for price.", "url": "https://cdn.carbuzz.com/car-thumbnails/700x375/14000/400/14406.jpg"

"id": 34, "make": "Lamborghini", "model": "Huracan Evo Spyder", "year": "2023", "description": "Following on from the Huracan Evo Coupe, the drop-top Spyder adds open-air thrills to one of the most exhilarating supercars on the road. Power comes from the same 5.2-liter V10 found in the Huracan Performante that produces 631 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque in the AWD version, with only a moderate drop in performance due to the extra weight of the Spyder with its lightweight soft-top. The 0-62 mph sprint passes by in a 3.1-second blur (just 0.2 seconds off the pace of the coupe) in the case of the AWD model, and the RWD version (with a detuned version of the V10) isn't far behind. The complex Lamborghini Integrated Vehicle Dynamics (LDVI) system expertly coordinates the car's dynamics based on parameters like driving mode and the conditions. Not only is it a spectacular driving machine, but the Evo's dramatic styling and eye-popping color options make every drive an event to remember. The Spyder versions of the Audi R8 and McLaren 600LT are direct competitors to the Huracan, but we're not sure that they're as outrageous to look at and to drive in, and it's the wildly gesticulating Italian that still has a way of turning the most heads.", "price": "Call for price.", "url": "https://cdn.carbuzz.com/car-thumbnails/700x375/14000/400/14408.jpg"

Codenamed LB744 and effectively replacing the Aventador Ultimae, the Revuelto is finally here.Whereas the Sian came with supercapacitor technology that saved weight but added tremendously to its price, the Revuelto uses a more conventional lithium-ion battery to create Lamborghini's first HPEV (High Performance Electrified Vehicle). With a new V12 and three electric motors, the Revuelto makes over 1,000 horsepower combined, edging even the magnificent Ferrari SF90 Stradale in that respect. Traditional Lamborghini traits like the scissor doors, elaborate styling, and high-revving V12 live alongside new facets to the Italian marque's mid-engined supercar formula, like an electric driving mode and a front structure made entirely from carbon fiber. It pushes the envelope in every sense, yet it appears that the Lambo DNA remains firmly intact.", "price": "Call for price.", "url": "https://cdn.carbuzz.com/car-thumbnails/700x375/14000/600/14652.jpg"

"id": 36, "make": "Lamborghini", "model": "Aventador  Ultimae", "year": "2022", "description": "It's with a bittersweet disposition and reluctant fingers that we have to type up this review of the 2022 Lamborghini Aventador Ultimae. We don't need to tell you that the car itself is breathtaking, both to the eye and also via your spine, ears, and fingertips as you unleash the full potential of its 769-horsepower naturally-aspirated 6.5-liter masterpiece of an engine. Sadly, the Aventador Ultimae is both the final iteration of the Aventador and the last implementation of the iconic V12 on its own before it is inevitably bolstered by a hybrid system. But as a final hurrah, the Ultimae is something special, capable of hitting 62 mph in 2.8 seconds and continuing on to a top speed of over 220 mph. The more comfortable and practical Ferrari 812 Superfast provides similar power and performance from its own V12 engine, and yet it's a vastly different experience. It's the way the Lamborghini involves you in the action at every opportunity that is this car's most defining trait. There are downsides that betray the car's age, though, such as the flawed single-clutch automatic gearbox and the confining cabin. But as Lamborghini's last ICE-only supercar and the final incarnation of the Aventador, its legendary status is cemented.", "price": "Call for price.", "url": "https://cdn.carbuzz.com/car-thumbnails/700x375/11000/500/11529.jpg"

"id": 37, "make": "Lamborghini", "model": "Aventador Ultimae Roadster", "year": "2022", "description": "In the sports world, we often watch with fascination and mixed emotions as younger upstarts gradually take the place of enduring legends in the twilight of their careers. The Lamborghini Aventador Ultimae Roadster is a new car but feels a lot like an enduring legend, too - it's the last roadster from Lamborghini that will have a non-hybridized, naturally-aspirated V12. Although not a replacement for this car, the Sian Roadster plays the role of the newer, bolder, but more unfamiliar upstart as it has a hybridized V12. It's one of the first signs of what's to come from Lamborghini in an electrified era. But right at this moment, the Aventador Ultimae deserves our full attention.The 6.5-liter V12 makes 769 horsepower and will send this dramatic drop-top to 62 mph in only 2.9 seconds. It shares much with the already exceptional SVJ but is even more powerful. Both all-wheel drive and four-wheel steering work together to realize a machine that surprises with its precision. Its transmission can't match the dual-clutch in the Ferrari 812 GTS, and the McLaren 720S Spider is even better to drive, but the Lambo's theatrics and jaw-dropping looks are pure theater. Like LeBron James, Serena Williams, or Tiger Woods, the Aventador's bones may be aging but it won't go down without an almighty fight.", "price": "Call for price.", "url": "https://cdn.carbuzz.com/car-thumbnails/700x375/11000/500/11528.jpg"

It has now gone on sale in the USA and its resume certainly makes for impressive reading. The car comes with a 523-horsepower version of the acclaimed Nettuno twin-turbocharged V6 engine first seen in the MC20 sports car, class-leading interior space, and excellent handling thanks to an adaptive air suspension and the Giorgio platform that does such a sterling job underneath the Alfa Romeo Stelvio. The Nettuno V6 gives the 2023 Grecale Trofeo blistering pace, propelling it to 60 mph in just 3.6 seconds - quick enough to leave the Porsche Macan GTS and BMW X3 M eating its dust. All of this is combined with a high-quality, tech-forward cabin and sultry looks, so it seems set to catapult right to the top rung of the podium, right? Well, with a steep $105k starting price, the new Maserati Grecale Trofeo is also a lot more expensive than these rivals, and this ambitious pricing strategy could prove to be its undoing.", "price": "Call for price.", "url": "https://cdn.carbuzz.com/car-thumbnails/700x375/14000/100/14144.jpg"
